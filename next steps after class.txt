This is a summary of my thoughts on how to better cement the knowledge gained from this course.

One major area the course did not cover was Javascript as it applies to the browser DOM. 
This is exceedingly important as the whole end goal is to modify/locate elements within the 
DOM. Hence:

1) Find research on browser dom api and javascript examples

The course reviewed bind, call, and apply rather well, but these functions are so ubiquitous
that more exercises/study materials are needed. So,

2) Locate as definitive but also as dense an example of possible detailing the usage of 
bind, call, apply.

Javascript's prototypal inheritance is so different than anything I've encountered in other languages
that this concept bears repitition and constant practice. Of particular note is gaining mastery and 
truly groking the following: 

3) 
    a) usage of the "new" operator and what it does on both sides of itself. I think the course mentioned
    infix notation.
    b) usage of Object.create(obj) and what the result of this is.
    c) how a & b are different
    d) when to use one approach over the other
    e) I think the usage of 'extend' relates/applies to these concepts also

4) The "new" es6 keywords and how they are used. Granted, these aren't new anymore, but still.
    a) class
    b) module
    c) function constructors
    d) let vs var
    e) function currying
    f) ... spread operator

5) Review anotated source of underscore.js. The library was obviously created with an intent
to teach others what is happening inside of it.

6) review usage/differences of typeof and instanceof

7) review the Greetr.js library created in this course. The paradigm used to initialize itself via the 
IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) and how it works by not requiring the usage of the 'new' operator
at all.
